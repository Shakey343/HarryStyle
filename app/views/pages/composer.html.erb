<h3>Forgive Us, Oh Father!</h3>
<p>To his surprise, a lazy but compassionate priest ends up in purgatory. As father Stephen-Peter recalls the confessions he has taken on earth, the archangels must decide whether he belongs in heaven or hell. The advice Stephen-Peter gave to his parishioners on earth led to hilarious situations with grave consequences. Are good intentions enough to save his soul?</p>
<p><i>Forgive Us, Oh Father!</i>-written with <a href="https://www.arnoudb.com/" target="_blank">Arnoud Breitbarth</a>-is an original farce, perfectly suited for festivals. It is an ensemble piece with one lead role and nine other substantial parts and can be performed in the round as easily as it can be on a thrust stage. The show appeals to comedy audiences and musical theatre fans alike, with cracking jokes and harmonies.</p>
<p>The show has enjoyed a run at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 2017 with Chevron Theatre after it was produced in October 2016 by Leeds University Union Music Theatre Society. Arnoud and I are currently developing the musical.</p>
