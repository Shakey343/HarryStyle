      <h2>Who am I?</h2>
      <p>I am a composer, arranger and musical director. My work has been broadcast on television and radio, and performed on various stages and concert halls around the UK. I have had the pleasure of working with so many inspiring and talented people along the way and I am always learning from experiences.</p>
      <p>With classical and jazz training at Junior Guildhall School of Music & Drama, I graduated from Mountview Academy of Theatre Arts with an MA in Writing Musicals, as well as a BA in Music from the University of Leeds.</p>
      <p>I am currently working on various ongoing and new projects, including <a href="#fuof"><b><i>Forgive Us, Oh Father!</i></b></a> which I am co-writing with <a href="http://arnoudb.com/" target="_blank"><b><i>Arnoud Breithbarth</i></b></a>, as well as the release of new material with the barbershop quartet <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ashatones" target="_blank"><b><i>The Ashatones</i></b></a>.</p>
